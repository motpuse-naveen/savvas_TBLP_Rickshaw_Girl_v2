      <p>3. Review student responses and discuss how adverbs might be used to describe vivid details and/or convey
         specific emotions (e.g. desperately conveys an intense emotion).
      </p>
      <p>4. Display the following sentences from the text and tell students to rewrite each
         sentence using a different adverb. Students may use adverbs from the word sort or other adverbs they know.</p>

         <ul class="small-bullet">
            <li>The wheels in Naima’s mind were spinning <i>wildly</i>. (p. 25)</li>
            <li><i>Desperately</i> Naima tried to turn the rickshaw,
            but she couldn’t seem to change direction. (p. 31)</li>
            <li><i>Slowly</i>, Mother eased a bangle over her hand and handed it to Father. (p. 46)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>5. Have students compare their sentences with a partner and discuss how different
