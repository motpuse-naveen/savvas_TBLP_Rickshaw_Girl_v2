<h2>Four Corners</h2>

<p>The Four Corners activity asks students to take a position on a thought-provoking statement. Use this activity as a warm-up for talking about the theme of gender bias in Rickshaw Girl.</p>
            <p>Follow these steps:</p>


<p><span class="bold">1.</span>Label the four corners of the room: Strongly agree, agree, strongly disagree, disagree</p>
               <p><span class="bold">2.</span>Display and read aloud the following statements one at a time:</p>
              <ul class="small-bullet">
					<li>Most parents have different expectations for girls and boys.</li>
                   <li>Boys shouldn’t cry.</li>
                   <li>Girls and boys should be taught differently.</li>
                   <li>There are some jobs that girls can’t do.</li>

				</ul>
               <p><span class="bold">3.</span>After reading aloud the statement, have students move to the corner that best represents their
                  opinion.</p>
               <p><span class="bold">4.</span>Once students have moved to their corner, have them discuss with other students why they chose that
                  position.</p>
               <p><span class="bold">5.</span>Encourage students to move to another corner if their opinion has changed after discussing
                  with other students</p>
