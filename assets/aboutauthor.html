                        <p>
                            Naima is a ten-year-old girl from Bangladesh who desperately wants to help her struggling
                            family pay their bills. She is a talented artist; however, there are few opportunities for
                            girls or women
                            to earn money in her village. <i>If only I had been born a boy</i>, she thought.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Naima decides to disguise
                            herself as a boy and use her father’s rickshaw to earn more money. However, before she can
                            carry out her
                            plan, she accidently crashes the rickshaw. Now the family must figure out how to pay for the
                            repairs to
                            the rickshaw.
                        </p>
                        <p>Determined to make things right, Naima goes to the market dressed as a boy in search of the
                            rickshaw repairman, hoping that <i>he</i>> might need a helper. To her surprise the rickshaw
                            repairman is a
                            woman. After learning that Naima is a girl, the rickshaw repairwoman hires her to paint
                            <i>alpanas</i> —a job
                            that <i>only</i> girls do. In the end, Naima realizes that <i>it’s a good thing she turned
                                out to be a girl.</i>
                        </p>

                            <span class="bold">Gender Roles</span> An important theme in Rickshaw Girl is the book’s
                            exploration of <span class="bold">gender roles and
                                stereotypes.</span> The young female protagonist, Naima, questions why girls in
                            Bangladesh must stay home and
                            help their mothers, while boys can work and earn money.
                        </p>
                        <p>The novel shows how Naima challenges the
                            expectations of her family, friends, and village of what a girl can do by disguising herself
                            as a boy. As
                            a boy, she sees women and girls in the market as “marigold blossoms in the grass,” and
                            enjoys the freedom
                            from the “curious eyes” of men.
