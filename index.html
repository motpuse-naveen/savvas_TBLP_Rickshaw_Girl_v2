                    <p>Write the Big Question on chart paper and read it aloud. Explain that when you connect with someone, you have a strong relationship with that person. You feel like you belong together, and you care for and understand each other. Tell students that enjoying time together watching a movie, talking, and playing are all ways that people can connect with each other.</p>

                    <p>Explain that authors use illustrations in stories for many reasons. For example, to show what is happening, to express feelings and emotions, or to give the reader information that the words don’t say. Tell students that at the beginning and end of <i>Drawn Together</i>, the author <span class="bold">only</span> uses illustrations to tell the story. So, they will need to look closely at the illustrations to figure out what is happening, and to understand what the characters are thinking, wondering, and feeling. </p>

                        Remind students that the author of <i> Drawn Together</i> uses illustrations to show what is happening in the story. He uses a dragon as a symbol to represent the differences between the boy and the grandfather.

                           <br>- Where do we see the dragon next? <i>(in the boy’s and grandfather’s drawings) </i>
                           <br>- Notice how the dragon begins to get bigger and bigger. What happens? <i>(The dragon gets between the boy and grandfather.) </i>

                           <br>- What do the boy and his grandfather do? <i>(They draw a bridge; they turn the dragon into a bridge)</i>
                           <br>- What does the bridge do? <i>(It brings the boy and grandfather together again.) </i>
                           <br>- How is the bridge a symbol? <i>(It represents the boy and grandfather coming together again and growing closer.)</i></p>

Tell students that one meaning is that the boy and grandfather’s “new world” was drawn by both of them. Then explain that “drawn together” also means to bring people closer together. Display the page showing the boy and grandfather hugging goodbye. Discuss what <i>drew</i> the boy and grandfather closer together. For example, spending time together and their shared love of art.
            </p>
                <p>After discussing the boy and his grandfather, tell students to think about the drawing they did before reading the story. How is their relationship with the person in their drawing similar to the boy and his grandfather? How is it different?

                                    A young boy arrives at his Thai grandfather’s house for a visit. The boy’s grandfather is very excited to see the boy. As they eat dinner and watch a movie, the two try to communicate, but because they do not speak the same language, they must find another way to understand each other.

                                <p>
                                    After a while, the boy gives up trying to talk, gets his art supplies, and begins to draw. When the grandfather sees what the boy is doing, he gets an idea. The grandfather gets his own art supplies and begins to draw alongside the boy. The two begin to form a strong bond as they create a whole new world. In their newly created world, however, a dragon emerges that threatens to split them apart again.

                                <p>The grandfather quickly swaps their drawing tools, and the two work together to transform the dragon into a bridge that brings them together again. At the end of the story, the boy, his grandfather, and mother are all overjoyed to find that the boy and his grandfather’s shared love of art has provided them with a way to connect without words.
