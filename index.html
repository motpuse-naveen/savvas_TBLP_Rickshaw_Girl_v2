            <div class="aboutBookContentSection">
               <p>Naima is a ten-year-old girl from Bangladesh who desperately wants to help her struggling
               family pay their bills. She is a talented artist; however, there are few opportunities for girls or women
               to earn money in her village. <span class="italicText">If only I had been born a boy</span>, she thought.</p>
               <p> Naima decides to disguise
               herself as a boy and use her father’s rickshaw to earn more money. However, before she can carry out her
               plan, she accidently crashes the rickshaw. Now the family must figure out how to pay for the repairs to
               the rickshaw.</p> 
               <p>Determined to make things right, Naima goes to the market dressed as a boy in search of the
               rickshaw repairman, hoping that <span class="italicText">he</span> might need a helper. To her surprise the rickshaw repairman is a
               woman. After learning that Naima is a girl, the rickshaw repairwoman hires her to paint <span class="italicText">alpanas</span> —a job
               that <span class="italicText">only</span> girls do. In the end, Naima realizes that <span class="italicText">it’s a good thing she turned out to be a girl.</span></p> 
               <p class="aboutHeader2 headingRole">Theme Overview </p>
               <p><b>Gender Roles</b> An important theme in Rickshaw Girl is the book’s exploration of <b>gender roles and
               stereotypes.</b> The young female protagonist, Naima, questions why girls in Bangladesh must stay home and
               help their mothers, while boys can work and earn money.</p>
               <p>The novel shows how Naima challenges the
               expectations of her family, friends, and village of what a girl can do by disguising herself as a boy. As
               a boy, she sees women and girls in the market as “marigold blossoms in the grass,” and enjoys the freedom
               from the “curious eyes” of men.</p>
