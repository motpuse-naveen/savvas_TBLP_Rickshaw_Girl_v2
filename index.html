                    <p><span class="bold">Science Standard: 1-ESS1-1.</span> Use observations of the sun, moon, and stars to describe patterns that can be predicted.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Content Objective:</span> Students will understand and differentiate between the phases of the moon.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Language Objective:</span>  Students will describe how the phases of the moon can be used to track time.</p>

                    <p>In this video, a teacher explains that the moon has different phases, and demonstrates what these phases look like.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Big Question:</span> Remind students of the Big Question: What can we learn from observing the night sky? Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">How do you think Observing Moon Phases will add to your ideas about the Big Question?</span></p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Preview Vocabulary</span></p>
                    <p>Discuss the words <i><span class="bold">moon, observe,</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">phase.</span></i> Lead a conversation around the meaning of each word with the class.</i> and <i><span class="bold">shapes</i>.</span> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class.</p>
                    <p>Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What is your favorite <span class="bold">phase</span> of the <span class="bold">moon</span>? How many moon phases can you name? Can you <span class="bold">observe</span> a new moon? </span></p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Oral Vocabulary</span> Some of the vocabulary in <i>Observing Moon Phases</i> might be new or challenging for students. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: Draw a crescent shape for students. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">A <span class="bold">crescent</span> is a shape that looks like this. Have you ever seen the moon look like this?</span> </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Word Web</span></p>
                    <p>Share a Word Web graphic organizer. To help students think about the relationships between words, guide them in creating a word web using the word <i>phase</i>. When they watch <i>Observing Moon Phases</i>, encourage them to add words to their web that relate to the word <i>phase</i>. A web for phase might look like this: </p>
                    <p>[a word web with <i>phase</i> in the center, and with <i>full moon, new moon, crescent,</i> and <i>gibbous</i> branching from it]</p>
