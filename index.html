                        a personal experience of when you challenged someone’s expectations. Use the following prompts

                    <p>Tell students that you are going to read some statements about girls and boys. After you read
                        each statement, have students move to the part of the room that reflects their opinion of the
                        statement. Invite students to share why they agree or disagree.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Statements:</span></p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>Most parents have different expectations for girls and boys.</li>
                        <li>Boys shouldn’t cry.</li>
                        <li>Girls and boys should be taught differently.</li>
                        <li>There are some jobs that girls can’t do.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Tell students that the statements they responded to are examples of gender bias. Ask students
                        to write a definition of gender bias based on what they learned from the activity. Then, this
                        definition: Gender bias is behavior that shows a favoritism of one gender over another.</p>
                    <h3>Write About It!</h3>
                    <p><span class="bold">Journal</span> Display the sentence frame below and have students write about
                        their experiences.</p>
                    <p>Because of my gender, people expect me to (be) _ _ _ _ _ _. But, actually I (am) _ _ _ _ _ _.</p>
                    <p>After students have finished writing, have them share with a partner what they wrote. Then,
                        encourage volunteers to tell the whole group about their partner’s experience with gender bias.

                    <h3>Words from Another Language.</h3>
                    <p>Remind students that Rickshaw Girl takes place in Bangladesh and that Bangla is the official
                        language of Bangladesh. Then, point out some of the Bangla words that appear italicized
                        throughout the novel and ask: <i>Why would an author use words from another language in a
                            story?</i></p>
                    <p>Highlight these key ideas:</p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>The words are unique to the culture of Bangladesh.</li>
                        <li>There isn’t an equivalent translation in English.</li>
                        <li>The words help ground the story to the setting.</li>
                        <li>The words lend authenticity to the story.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Tell students that as they come across these words, they should use context clues or the
                        <i>Glossary of Bangla Words</i> at the end of the book to determine the meanings.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Shades of Meaning</h3>>
                    <p><i><span class="bold">Rickshaw Girl</span></i>, the author incorporates a wide array of adverbs
                        to convey tone and
                        intensity
                        of actions. Encourage students to explore adverbs in the following activity that springs from
                        adverbs that appear in the book.</p>
                    <p>Write the words: <i>fiercely, gently, firmly, delicately</i> on the board. In their journals have
                        students draw a graphic as shown here and put the words in order from least intense to most
                        intense. Encourage students to discuss the nuances of meaning with each word.</p>

                    <table class="intensetable" style="width: 100%;">

                        Bangladesh. She loves painting beautiful designs called alpanas, but badly wishes she could help
                        earn money for the family by helping her father drive his rickshaw, which is forbidden for
                        girls.
                        She secretly meets with her friend, Saleem, who gives her the idea that she can drive the
                        rickshaw
                        if she disguises herself as a boy.</p>
