                    <p>This text set includes four informational texts and a video. All deal with an aspect of observing
                        the night sky and the patterns that can be found around the sun, moon, and stars.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">In the Sky</span> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the needs of
                        your class, you may choose to assign <span class="bold">In the Sky</span> for independent reading, or you may
                        choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in
                        concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read
                        the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure
                        and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage
                        students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the chart below to see where
                        specific text appear across the texts in this set.

                        Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What time of day do you see the <span class="bold">moon</span>
                            in the sky? When is the <span class="bold">sun</span> in the sky? Do you know which <span

                            carefully. What do you notice when you observe the moon in the sky?</span> Or: <span

                            prediction. In the morning, what do you <span class="bold">predict</span> you will see in

                        encourage them to add words to their web that relate to the word <i>sky</i>. A web for

                    <p>Have students apply what they’ve learned from the text set to demonstrate and enhance their
                        understanding. Review the <a href="#">Project Rubric</a> with students, explaining in detail the
                        expectations for the project.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Sky Tour!</span></p>
                    <p>Have students draw a picture of the night sky. Ask them to make sure they include at least three
                        objects they read about in this text set.</p>
                    <p>Have them plan and practice how they would give a tour of the night sky. What would they say
                        about each thing in the sky? What interesting information from their reading would they share?
                    </p>
                    <p>Students can refer to what they wrote in Write About the Big Question for each text to aid their
                        thinking and planning. They may also use the <a href="#">Project Template</a> to help them
                        organize and clarify their thinking as they plan their projects. Encourage them to use the
                        vocabulary they’ve learned from the texts in their tours.</p>
                    <p>When they are finished planning their tours, provide students with a variety of settings in which
                        they can share their tours, such as in a small group setting, for the whole class, or with a
                        single partner.</p>
